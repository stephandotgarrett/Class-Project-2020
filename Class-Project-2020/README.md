# Class-Project-2020
Class project for 2020

My class project will be a C# console "game" in which the player attempts to "catch" pokemon. I will be using a csv of pokemon with stats as a base of information. Each player will create a profile and choose a pokemon to start with from options pulled from the csv file and then allowed to "explore" to find more pokemon to collect. The player profiles will be saved with the players name, rank, and collection for access later.

The following is a list of target dates with goals to complete by each date

Target Dates:
3/24 - Have plan and readme complete and submitted for approval

3/30 - Map menus, create menu navigation logic, and create menu prompts

4/6 - New player and continue routines

4/20 - Functions to print player info, travel to find pokemon and catch pokemon
