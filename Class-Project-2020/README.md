## Pokemon Adventure Project ##
Class project for CodeLouisville 2020

## Project Summary ##
My class project will be a C# console game in which the player travels in search of pokemon to catch them all. I will be using a csv of pokemon with stats as a base of information. Each player will create a profile and choose a pokemon to start with from options pulled from the csv file and then allowed to explore via prompts in the console to find more pokemon to collect. The player profile will be saved with the players name, partner, and collection for access later.
Follow to in console menus and enjoy!

## Technical Summary ##
This project is written in C# and uses a modified csv file found on Kaggle.com

## Features ##
Easy to use interactive console navigation leads you on a journey to find pokemon in the wild
